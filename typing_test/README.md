# Speed Typing Test

A simple and interactive speed typing test built using Python and the `curses` library. This program allows users to type a given target text and calculates their words per minute (WPM) while tracking correct and incorrect keystrokes.

---

## Features

- **Speed Typing Test**: Type the target text and the program will calculate your WPM.
- **Word Per Minute (WPM)**: The program tracks and displays your WPM as you type.
- **Correct vs Incorrect Characters**: Correct characters are displayed in green, while incorrect ones are shown in red.
- **Real-time Updates**: WPM is updated as you type.
- **Backspace Support**: You can delete incorrect characters using backspace.
- **Exit on Escape**: Press the Escape key to exit the test at any time.

---

## How It Works

1. **Start Screen**:
   - The game begins by displaying a welcome message and waits for any key to start.

2. **Typing Test**:
   - You type the target text as quickly and accurately as possible.
   - Correct characters will appear in green, while incorrect characters will be displayed in red.
   - The WPM is calculated and updated in real-time based on your typing speed.

3. **End the Test**:
   - The test ends once you complete the target text.
   - Press any key to exit after completing the test.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.6+** installed on your system.
- The `curses` library, which is part of the standard library in Unix-based systems (e.g., Linux and macOS). For Windows, you might need to install `windows-curses` to run the program.

To install `windows-curses` (if using Windows), run:
```bash
pip install windows-curses
```

---

## How to Run

1. Save the script as `typing_test.py`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python typing_test.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the test.

## Example Gameplay

```plaintext
Welcome to the speed typing test!
Press any key to begin!
```

After starting, the target text appears:
```plaintext
Hello world this is some test text for this app!
WPM: 0
```

As you type, the screen updates, and incorrect characters are highlighted in red:
```plaintext
Hello worlD this is some test text for this app!
WPM: 50
```

Once you complete the text:
```plaintext
You completed the test! Press any key to exit.
```

---

## Customization

- **Change Target Text**: Modify the `target_text` variable in the script to change the text for the typing test.
- **Adjust WPM Calculation**: Modify the logic for calculating WPM to suit your preferences.

---

## Notes

- The game uses a basic text interface and is ideal for testing your typing speed in a fun way.
- The program exits when you complete the test or press the Escape key.
- Only basic ASCII characters are supported for input.
