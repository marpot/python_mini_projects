# Dice Game: Race to 50

This is a multiplayer dice game where 2â€“4 players take turns rolling a die. The goal is to be the first player to reach or exceed a score of 50. Rolling a "1" ends the player's turn and resets their score for that turn to zero. The game features an interactive and competitive gameplay experience.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**:
   - Each player starts with a score of 0.
   - The first player to reach a total score of **50** wins.

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
   - On their turn, they can choose to roll the die or end their turn:
     - **If the die shows 2â€“6**: Add the value to the current turn's score.
     - **If the die shows 1**: The player's turn ends immediately, and their score for the current turn resets to 0.
   - At the end of a turn, the player's total score is updated.

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - The game ends as soon as a player reaches or exceeds a score of 50.
   - If multiple players achieve the same highest score in the final round, the game results in a tie.
