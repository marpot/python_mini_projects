# Mini Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects, each demonstrating different concepts and techniques. These projects are perfect for learning, experimentation, or inspiration.

Each project is contained within its own folder, with its own dedicated `README.md` explaining how to run and understand the specific project.

## Projects List

Below is a list of the mini Python projects included in this repository:

1. **[Adventure Game](./adventure_game/)**  
   A text-based adventure game where your choices determine the outcome, demonstrating how to create interactive storytelling and decision-making mechanics in Python.

2. **[Alarm Clock](./alarm_clock/)**  
   A simple Python script that plays an alarm sound using the `playsound` library. Perfect for triggering sound alerts in your applications.

3. **[Madlibs Generator](./madlibs_generator/)**  
   A fun interactive Python script that lets you create a customized story by filling in placeholders with your own words. The script dynamically detects placeholders in a story and allows you to personalize the tale with your inputs.

4. **[Number Guesser](./number_guesser/)**  
   A fun and interactive Python game where you try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides hints and tracks your attempts until you find the correct number.

5. **[Password Manager with Encryption](./password_manager/)**  
   A secure Python-based password manager that uses encryption to safely store and manage account credentials. It combines a master password and a key file to encrypt passwords, ensuring privacy and security.

6. **[Typing Speed Test](./typing_test/)**  
   A console-based typing speed test using Python's `curses` library. This project calculates your typing speed in words per minute (WPM) while testing you on a sample sentence. It also provides feedback on your typing accuracy, showing correct characters in green and incorrect ones in red.

7. **[Pig Game](./pig_game/)**  
   A multiplayer dice game where players race to reach a score of 50. Rolling a "1" resets the current turn's score. The game supports 2-4 players and tracks scores dynamically, ending when a player reaches 50.

8. **[Quiz Game](./quiz_game/)**  
   A quiz game where you answer questions related to computer acronyms like CPU, GPU, RAM, and ROM. The game tracks your score and accuracy, offering a fun way to test your knowledge of basic computer terms.

9. **[Rock Paper Scissors](./rock_paper_scissors/)**  
   A simple text-based game where you compete against the computer in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game tracks wins, losses, and draws, and allows you to quit anytime by typing "Q".

10. **[Math Quiz Game](./timed_math_challenge/)**  
    A timed quiz to test your arithmetic skills with random addition, subtraction, and multiplication problems. The game tracks your score and total time to complete the quiz, challenging you to answer quickly and accurately.

11. **[Turtle Racing Game](./turtle_race/)**  
    A fun racing game using Python’s turtle module. Players select the number of racers, and the turtles race across the screen. The first to cross the finish line wins, and the game announces the winner’s color.
