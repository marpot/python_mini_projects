# Alarm Sound Player

A simple Python script that plays an alarm sound using the `playsound` library. Perfect for triggering sound alerts in your applications.

---

## Features

- **Simple Implementation**: Plays an alarm sound from a given `.mp3` file.
- **Customizable**: Easily replace the alarm sound with any `.mp3` file.
- **Lightweight**: Requires minimal code and dependencies.

---

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   If you haven't already, clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Install the Dependencies**:
   Before running the script, install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary dependencies, such as the `playsound` library.

3. **Download or Prepare an Alarm Sound**:
   Ensure you have an `.mp3` file, for example, `alarm_sound.mp3`, in the same directory as the script or specify the correct path to your audio file.

4. **Run the Script**:
   Save the script as `alarm_clock.py` and run it using:

   ```bash
   python alarm_clock.py
   ```

   The script will play the alarm sound (`alarm_sound.mp3`).

## Example

Hereâ€™s the basic code to play an alarm sound:

```python
from playsound import playsound

playsound("alarm_sound.mp3")
```

Make sure that the file `alarm_sound.mp3` is in the same folder as the script, or provide the full path to the file.

## Customization

- **Change the Sound**: Replace the file `alarm_sound.mp3` with any `.mp3` file of your choice.
- **Add Multiple Sounds**: Use the `playsound` function multiple times to play different sounds based on conditions.
