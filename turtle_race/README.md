# Turtle Racing Game

A fun racing game built using Python's `turtle` module! Players can choose the number of racers (2-10), and the colorful turtles will race to the finish line. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins!

## Features
- **Interactive Setup**: Choose the number of racers (2-10).
- **Colorful Racing**: Turtles are assigned random vibrant colors.
- **Random Movement**: Each turtle moves a random distance on every turn, making the race unpredictable and exciting.
- **Visual and Console Output**: Watch the race unfold on the screen and see the winner announced in the console.

## Game Flow

1. **Setup**:
   - The program initializes a `turtle` window with dimensions 700x700.
   - Turtles are placed at the starting positions, spaced evenly across the screen.

2. **The Race**:
   - Turtles move forward a random distance on each step.
   - The race continues until one turtle crosses the finish line (top of the screen).

3. **Winner Announcement**:
   - The winning turtle's color is printed in the console.

## Customization
